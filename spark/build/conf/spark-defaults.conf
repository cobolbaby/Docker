# Default system properties included when running spark-submit.
# This is useful for setting default environmental settings.

# Example:
# spark.master                     spark://master:7077
# spark.eventLog.enabled           true
# spark.eventLog.dir               hdfs://namenode:8021/directory
# spark.serializer                 org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
# spark.driver.memory              5g
# spark.executor.extraJavaOptions  -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Dkey=value -Dnumbers="one two three"

spark.driver.memory                     4g
spark.driver.maxResultSize              4g

# Interval between each executor's heartbeats to the driver. Heartbeats let the driver know that the executor is still alive 
# and update it with metrics for in-progress tasks. spark.executor.heartbeatInterval should be significantly less than spark.network.timeout
spark.executor.heartbeatInterval        60s

# If set to "true", performs speculative execution of tasks. 
# This means if one or more tasks are running slowly in a stage, 
# they will be re-launched.
# spark.speculation                     true

# ************ Dynamic Allocation **************
# Whether to use dynamic resource allocation, which scales the number of executors registered with this application up and down based on the workload
spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled         false
# Dynamic allocation of executors requires the external shuffle service. You may enable this through spark.shuffle.service.enabled.
spark.shuffle.service.enabled           false
# If dynamic allocation is enabled and an executor has been idle for more than this duration, the executor will be removed
spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout 60s

# Spark的work目录会随着spark-submit提交任务不断膨胀，所以需要定期清理
spark.worker.cleanup.enabled            false
# 清理周期，每隔多长时间清理一次，单位秒
spark.worker.cleanup.interval           3600
# 保留最近多长时间的数据: 3600s * 24 * 30
